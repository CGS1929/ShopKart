# Project Title
Shop-Kart: Responsive E-commerce Front-End (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap)

# Description
This is a modern and fully responsive front-end template for an e-commerce store, named Shop-Kart. It is built entirely using core web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and the powerful Bootstrap 5 framework for a clean, mobile-first design.

This project focuses on the user interface and client-side interactivity, making it a perfect portfolio piece to demonstrate fundamental web development skills.

# Core Features:

Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap's Grid System to ensure the layout looks great on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

Product Display: Clean and organized product listing, detail pages, and featured sections.

Interactive Cart: Uses vanilla JavaScript to handle shopping cart functionality (Add to Cart, Remove Item, Update Quantity, Calculate Total).

Modern Styling: Styled with custom CSS and Bootstrap components for a professional, sleek, and intuitive user experience.

Simple Navigation: A clear and easy-to-use navigation bar with links to Home, Shop, About Us, and Contact Us.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structural markup of all pages.

CSS3: For custom styling and visual enhancements.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For client-side interactivity, dynamic content updates, and shopping cart logic.

Bootstrap 5: For a responsive layout, pre-built components (navbar, carousel, cards, forms), and utility classes.
